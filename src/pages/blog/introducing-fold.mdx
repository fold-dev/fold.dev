# Launch

MDX is a powerful format that allows you to write JSX inside markdown. This enables you to use React components alongside your markdown content. Let's dive into the features and possibilities of MDX.

## Why Use MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of markdown with the flexibility of React. This combination allows for:

- Easy embedding of interactive components
- Reusability of components across different posts
- Enhanced styling and functionality

## Getting Started with MDX

To start using MDX, you'll need to install the necessary packages:

<Code snippet="npm i --save @fold-dev/core @fold-dev/design" />
{/* 
export default ({ children }) => <BlogLayout>{children}</BlogLayout>
 */}
