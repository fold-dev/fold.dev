                        The sole dependencies are React and ReactDOM, along with any additional libraries you integrate
                        into your project. There are no other dependencies.

                    <AccordionPanel>
                        Fold utilizes pure CSS to tailor the appearance of components and provides helper classes for
                        added customization.
